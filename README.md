# CS428Project2
The screenshots are attached, I was unable to get the project to actually function but in theory it should be working perfectly. There were no issues with compilation on my virtual Linux machine or in remote. Had I been able to officially run the code, I would have been able to provide a more accurate report of the pass/fail test cases but based off the logic, I cannot think of too many cases that would result in failure since I did extensive error handling. 

I believe that the code should work, I was just unable to get it to actually run. If it's possible, I'd like to try and demo the code in office hours so I can receive help with actually properly running the code.
